    "Can movie genre, length, and audience scores really help predict Rotten Tomatoes critic scores? In this project, I want to dig into how these factors might impact the way critics rate movies. By looking at genre, runtime, and audience feedback, we can uncover valuable insights that filmmakers and studios can use to make smarter choices when creating films. If we can build a model that predicts critic scores based on these characteristics, it could give creators a leg up in understanding what resonates with both audiences and critics alike. Exploring these relationships might also reveal other interesting factors that play a role in shaping critical opinions, helping us get a better idea of what makes a movie successful in the eyes of reviewers."

    "I plan to use web scraping to collect movie data from Rotten Tomatoes, focusing on key details like genre, release dates, critic scores, and audience scores. This approach allows me to gather important information that can be useful for analysis. I'll run calculations to assess the relationship between these variables and critics/audience scores. To gain further insights into audience reception, I may also explore additional movie metadata, such as box office performance or awards. By combining these data points, I aim to identify trends or patterns that could help predict rotten tomatoes scores, offering valuable insights reviewers and potentially finding bias in reviews."

    " the DataFrame still requires some cleaning and organization. For instance, while the genre is straightforward in this dataset, the scores are presented as strings with percentage signs, which will need conversion to ints for effective analysis. Additionally, I will also convert the release column to a date time object for simplicity and to cut down on. There is also a problem with movies having multiple genres so I may need to clean for repeats If I combine different genres. As I progress, I plan to investigate the relationships between the various attributes, particularly focusing on how the genre and scores correlate with each other. Although I havenâ€™t yet covered machine learning models in my studies, I see potential for using regression to predict scores based on movie features or classification techniques to analyze patterns within the genres. Further exploration into these methods will help deepen my analysis and potentially lead to uncovering bias in film review world.\n",
