# Rotten Tomatoes Movie Scraper

This project is a Python-based web scraper that extracts movie data from the Rotten Tomatoes website. The scraper gathers movie details, including the movie name, release date, critic score, audience score, and genre, and stores this data in a Pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and manipulation.
